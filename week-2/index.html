    <h1>Welcome to Week 2 - My first GitHub repository!!</h1>

    <p>
        This is my first time using github

        <br>

        I think coding will be fun 

        <br>

        I took a coding class before and it was alright, I was confused a lot.

        <br>

        I want to try using the command line
