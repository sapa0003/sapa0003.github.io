                    in a welcoming, safe, inclusive and inviting environment for students of all backgrounds, cultures
                    and abilities to spark a movement.

                    is this going to cost me? This facility will be included in your activity fee. All fee-paying
                    students can use and participate in all activities in the building. As for the facility, it will
                    cost Algonquin College $48.8 million.
