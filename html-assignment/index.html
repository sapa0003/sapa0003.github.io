                Hello my name is Nesia and this is my first year at Algonquin in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program. I have a previous education at the University of Ottawa with a <em>Bachelor’s degree in Communication</em>. Upon graduating, I realized I was not satisfied with my education and wished I was able to learn in more hands on classes, I love photography and video and want to have a career in the area but I felt that my skills were lacking.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was born of the 3<sup>rd</sup> of September. In my free time I enjoy singing, playing guitar, and more recently, stealing my brother’s Nintendo Switch. I enjoy games such as Fire Emblem Three Houses and Animal Crossing. I also enjoy travelling and have visited places such as the U.K., Singapore, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand.
            </p>
