Reflection

The mockup for this website was created for this semester's user experience class. I wanted to create a website that would be easy to code based on my knowledge learned in this class but still be aesthetically pleasing and user friendly. To simplify the code so I could create it in an reasonable amout of time I used Bootstrap to create the majority of the framework. I stuck to using elements that I was already familiar on using because it was easy me to troubleshoot and find solutions to certain issues as I already had the knowledge of how each component worked and how they need to look like in the end. To simplify the coding process my skill icons and progress bars were created using adobe XD, the icons were taken from icon fonts and I later added on a circle background in XD and saved them as a newer svg as I was unfamiliar in creating a icon in a shape.

Despite trying to create this site to be as simple for me as possible there were still areas that I struggled with.

One thing I had some issues with was adding the right Bootstrap class to include features that would be exclusively shown in small screen. In my prototype I had the logo in my navbar in the center to be in the middle and despite trying to use the sm classes, the logo would not shift. I had also plan to not have the row with the secondary nav that allows you to switch from photography, graphic design and video to be a singular title on smaller screens but the issue I had while using the sm class was having the row appear solely on small screen sizes then dissapearing on larger screens.

Another issue I had was vertical alignment, from what I was reading on Bootstrap the aligned items classes only worked for flexbox and although I would try to add flexx classes to parent items and have align items go to the child items sometimes things would not align center such as the home main banner.

Although minor, in my photo galleries I was not able to get my photos to fit the right ratios for them to end evenly at the bottom of the page. Although I had cropped my images through the specific width and height from my XD mockup, when placed into the code they were not able to align as I wanted.

A final thing to add, was during my coding process I decided to change how I wanted the work page to look like. In the mockup, under each of the categories I had placed a button underneath them so the user can click those to navigate the specific page. But for user experience purposes I decided to omit that element when coding it as users would be more likely to click the image itself of the title instead. Because of time I was not able to change my mockup.
